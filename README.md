# JavaScript

## What is Javascript?

- Javascript is a computer programming language which is:
    - light-weight (doesn't eat up lot of computer memory), 
    - cross-platform, (multiple platofrms, not just web development) 
    - object-oriented (language is based on objects) 

- JS is one of the 3 core technolgies of web development. 
    - HTML => Content
    - CSS => Presentation/styling
    - JS => Dynamic effects/ programming

    `HTML` -> Nouns
    Eg: 
    ```
    <p><p> (means "paragraph")
    ```

    `CSS` -> Adjectives
    Eg:
    ```
    p {color: red;} (means "paragraph text is red")
    ```

    `JS` -> Verbs
    Eg:
    ```
    p.hide(); (means "hide the paragraph")
    ```

 
- Today, JS can be used in different places:
    - *Client-side: Javascript was tradiitonally only been used on browsers.*
    - Server-side: With node.js we can use it on server too.

- Javascript makes modern web development possible:
    - Dynamic effects and interactivity
    - Modern web apps that we can interact with.

- Frameworks/Libraries like React and Angular are 100% based on javascript.
